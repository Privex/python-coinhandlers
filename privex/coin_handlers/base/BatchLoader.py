      +===================================================+

    This class is designed to save you time from re-writing your own "batching" / "chunking" functions.

    Batching / chunking is a memory efficiency technique to prevent RAM leaks causing poor performance or crashes.
    Instead of loading all 1K - 10K transactions into memory, you load only a small amount of transactions, such as
    100 transactions, then you use a Python generator (the yield keyword) to return individual transactions, quietly
    loading the next "batch" / "chunk" of 100 TXs after the first set has been processed, without interrupting the
    caller's `for` loop or other iteration.

    This allows other functions to iterate over the transactions and process them on the fly, instead of having to load
    the entire 1-10K transaction list into memory first.

    The use of generators throughout this class helps to prevent the problem of RAM leaks due to constant
    duplication of the transaction list (e.g. self.transactions, self.filtered_txs, self.cleaned_txs), especially
    when the transaction lists contains thousands of transactions.

    To use this class, simply extend it (instead of BaseLoader), and make sure to implement the two abstract methods:

     - `load_batch` - Loads and stores a small batch of raw (original format) transactions for a given coin
     - `clean_txs`  - Filters the loaded TXs, yielding TXs (conformed to be compatible with :class:`models.Deposit`)
                      that were received by us (not sent), and various sanity checks depending on the type of coin.

    If your Loader is for a coin which uses an account/memo system, set `self.need_account = True` before calling
    BatchLoader's constructor, and it will remove coins in self.symbols/coins that do not have a non-empty/null
    `our_account` column.

    You're free to override any methods if you need to, just make sure to call this class's constructor __init__
    before/after your own constructor, otherwise some methods may break.

        Important things when implementing this function:

        - Make sure to filter out transactions that were sent from our own wallet/account - otherwise internal
          transfers will cause problems.
        - Make sure each transaction is destined to us

          - If your loader is account-based, make sure to only yield transactions where tx["to_account"] == account.
          - If your loader is address-based, make sure that you only return transactions that are being received by
            our wallet, not being sent from it.

            - If ``account`` isn't None, assume that you must yield TXs sent to the given crypto address ``account``

        - If your loader deals with smart contract networks e.g. ETH, EOS, make sure that you only return transactions
          valid on the matching smart contract, don't blindly trust the symbol!
        - Make sure that every dict that you ``yield`` conforms with the return standard shown for
          :py:meth:`BaseLoader.list_txs`

        - While transactions is normally a list<dict> you should assume that it could potentially be a
          Generator, writing the code Generator-friendly will ensure it can handle both lists and Generator's.

        >>>             if tx['to'].lower() != account.lower(): continue  # If we aren't the receiver, we don't need it.
