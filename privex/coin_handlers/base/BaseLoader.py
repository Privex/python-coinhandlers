    BaseLoader - Base class for Transaction loaders

    A transaction loader loads incoming transactions from one or more cryptocurrencies or tokens, whether through
    a block explorer, or through a direct connection to a local RPC node such as steemd or bitcoind using connection
    settings set by the user in the passed settings.

    Transaction loaders must be able to initialise themselves using the following data:

    - The coin symbols ``self.symbols`` passed to the constructor
    - The setting_xxx fields on ``self.coin`` :class:`payments.models.Coin`
    - The Django settings `from django.conf import settings`
    - They should also use the logging instance ``settings.LOGGER_NAME``

    If your class requires anything to be added to the Coin object settings, or the Django ``settings`` file,
    you should write a comment listing which settings are required, which are optional, and their format/type.

    e.g. (Optional) settings.STEEM_NODE - list of steem RPC nodes, or string of individual node, URL format

    They must implement all of the methods in this class, as well as configure the `provides` list to display
    the tokens/coins that this loader handles.
