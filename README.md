# Privex's Python Coin Handlers

Work-in-progress. Coin handlers were originally written for one of our open source projects:
[privex/cryptotoken-converter](https://github.com/Privex/cryptotoken-converter)

This project contains independent versions of our coin handlers that can be used with any python project, regardless
of framework. Coin handlers can be used for handling receiving, sending, and issuing of coins.

**Official Repo:** https://github.com/privex/python-coinhandlers

# Installation

Minimum Python version is **Python 3.6** - but we recommend **Python 3.7** for best compatibility.

```sh
pip3 install privex-coinhandlers
```

# Example usage:

### Note on Context Managers

As of Version 1.1.0 - context management was added to some coin handlers, as well as dummy context
management for handlers that don't need it.

It's recommended to use context management (`with` statements) when using a loader/manager
to ensure connections, database sessions etc. are opened and closed cleanly.

```python
from privex.coin_handlers import MoneroLoader, get_loader, Coin

###
# Context management when using on-the-fly programmatic loading
###

with get_loader('XMR') as m:
    m.load()
    txs = m.list_txs()

###
# Context management when directly using loader/manager classes
###

settings = dict(
    COIND_RPC=dict(XMR=dict(user='monero', password='SomeRPCPassword', port=18100))
)

xmrcoin = Coin(symbol='XMR', symbol_id='XMR')

with MoneroLoader(settings=settings, coins=[xmrcoin]) as m:
    m.load()
    txs = m.list_txs()

```

### Using a loader/manager directly

```python
from privex.coin_handlers import BitcoinLoader, BitcoinManager, Coin

settings = dict(
    COIND_RPC=dict(
        BTC={}
    )
)

# A Coin object generally only needs ``symbol`` and ``symbol_id``
# Account-based coins such as Steem and EOS will also need ``our_account`` (your sending/receiving account)
# Most coins should work without any ``setting_`` options, unless they depend on authentication with local daemon
# e.g. the Bitcoin handler depends on a user/pass to connect to bitcoind 
c = Coin(
    setting_user='bitcoinrpc', 
    setting_pass='SomeSecureRPCPassword',
    setting_json='{"confirms_needed": 1}',
    symbol='BTC',     # A unique symbol or ID that you use to identify this coin in your app (returned by list_txs())
    symbol_id='BTC'   # The ``symbol_id`` **MUST** match the native coin symbol for the network you use it on.
)


######
#
# Coin Handler Loaders
#
######

# Loaders expect both ``settings`` (a dict containing symbols mapped to dicts containing settings),
# as well as a ``List[Coin]`` containing :class:`privex.coin_handlers.base.objects.Coin` objects they should handle.
# A loader's sole purpose is handling incoming deposit transactions, something which could easily be done through
# a third party service such as a block explorer.
bl = BitcoinLoader(settings=settings, coins=[c])

# list_txs() is a generator which outputs Deposit objects (which can also be converted to dict's)
txs = bl.list_txs()
next(txs)
# <Deposit coin='BTC' amount='0.00177883' address='3xxxxxKYQLH24Aa3xxxxtL3mggxxx'>

x = next(txs)
print(dict(x))
# {
# 'coin': 'BTC', 'txid': '8xxxx5a1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx2dd81xxxxxx5973', 
# 'vout': 0, 'address': '3xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', 
# 'amount': Decimal('0.00012434'), 'tx_timestamp': datetime.datetime(2019, 4, 5, 4, 34, 45, tzinfo=<UTC>)
# }

print(x.address)
# 3xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

######
#
# Coin Handler Managers
#
######

# Managers expect ``settings`` and ``coin`` (that's ONE coin, not a list).
# A manager handles everything other than deposits, it generally handles functions such as address generation,
# sending/issuing coins, and running health checks on a coin.
bm = BitcoinManager(settings=settings, coin=c)

# health_test() returns True (dependant service e.g. bitcoind is working fine), or False (service is broken)
# This can be used to detect whether there's a problem with the RPC node *before* running any sending code.
bm.health_test()
# True


bm.health()
# (
#   'BitcoinManager', 
#   ('Symbol', 'Status', 'Current Block', 'Version', 'Wallet Balance', 'P2P Connections'), 
#   (
#      'BTC', '<b style="color: green">Online</b>', '586,662 (Headers: 586,662)', 
#      '170100 (/Satoshi:0.17.1/)', '0.1234567', '8'
#   )
# )

bm.get_deposit()

# ('address', '3GnzkkGHZSdBFRYXhhk34xFTuN4cpm1M6W')

```

### Programmatic loading of handlers

Using the coin handler helper functions in ``privex/coin_handlers/__init__.py`` it's possible to load handlers 
on-the-fly using user specified handler names, and lookup the correct handler just using the coin symbol.


```python
import privex.coin_handlers as ch
from privex.coin_handlers import Coin

# In the example code, there are three coin handlers entered by default: Steem, Monero and Bitcoin
print(ch.COIN_HANDLERS.keys())
# dict_keys(['Bitcoin', 'Steem', 'Monero'])

# To ensure the coin handlers you want to use, are actually loaded, you should call enable_handler
# It won't hurt if they're already enabled.
ch.enable_handler('Bitcoin', 'Monero')

# Add Dogecoin to the coins handled by the ``Bitcoin`` coin handler.
ch.add_handler_coin('Bitcoin', Coin(symbol='DOGE', symbol_id='DOGE'))

# Add connection settings for DOGE's handler instances
ch.configure_coin('DOGE', user='dogerpc', password='SomeSecret', port=22555)

# Some handlers such as Monero come with their native coin pre-added. You can check if a handler has
# a certain coin with `handler_has_coin`
ch.handler_has_coin('Monero', 'XMR')
# True

# Add connection and wallet configuration settings for Monero (XMR)
# wallet = Monero wallet filename, walletpass = Wallet encryption password, account = Wallet account
ch.configure_coin(
    'XMR',
    user='monero', password='SomeRPCPassword', port=18100, confirms_needed=0,
    wallet='mnrwallet', walletpass='SomeWalletPassword', account='mywalletaccount'
)

# Force reload the handlers
ch.reload_handlers()

# As we can see, if we pass the symbol DOGE to get_loader we get a BitcoinLoader object  
doge = ch.get_loader('DOGE')
# <privex.coin_handlers.Bitcoin.BitcoinLoader.BitcoinLoader object at 0x10ac0f160>

# We cam also see in the loader object that our coin options were injected into the Loader settings, with the password
# 'SecurePass' and username 'dogerpc'.
print(doge.settings['DOGE'])
# {
#   'host': '127.0.0.1', 'port': 8332, 'user': 'dogerpc', 'password': 'SecurePass', 
#   'confirms_needed': 0, 'use_trusted': True, 'string_amt': True
# }

```

file (e.g. code comments), or inside of it's containing folder (e.g. a file named LICENSE). 

You should let us know in your pull request or issue that you've included files which are licensed
separately, so that we can make sure there's no license conflicts that might stop us being able
to accept your contribution.

If you'd rather read the whole legal text, it should be included as `privex_contribution_agreement.txt`.

### (Alternative) Manual install from Git

If you don't want to PyPi (e.g. for development versions not on PyPi yet), you can install the 
project directly from our Git repo.

Unless you have a specific reason to manually install it, you **should install it using pip3 normally**
as shown above.

**Option 1 - Use pip to install straight from Github**

```sh
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Privex/python-coinhandlers
```

**Option 2 - Clone and install manually**

```bash
# Clone the repository from Github
git clone https://github.com/Privex/python-coinhandlers
cd python-coinhandlers

# RECOMMENDED MANUAL INSTALL METHOD
# Use pip to install the source code
pip3 install .

# ALTERNATIVE INSTALL METHOD
# If you don't have pip, or have issues with installing using it, then you can use setuptools instead.
python3 setup.py install
```

# Thanks for reading!
